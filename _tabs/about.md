OLAA! I'm **Dalvyn Suhada**, though most call me Dalvyn. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems at Hasanuddin University, where I'm constantly exploring the dynamic realms of **digital technologies, artificial intelligence, and web development**. Beyond the screen, I have a strong passion for **photography and videography**, finding joy in capturing and creating visual stories.
